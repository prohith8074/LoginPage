# LoginPage
**GoAL** Integrate client-side validation using JavaScript to provide real-time feedback to users as they fill out the signup form.
**Functionality:**
The signup form will have several input fields (customize the number and types based on your needs). (e.g., username, email address, password)
Below each input field, a short message will provide guidance on format requirements. (e.g., "Username must be alphanumeric and at least 6 characters long.")
As users type in each field, JavaScript code will validate the input in real-time.
Valid input will trigger a green message indicating successful validation.
Invalid input will trigger a red message explaining the issue (e.g., "Email address must be in a valid format").
The submit button will remain disabled until all fields are valid. Once all validations pass, the submit button will become active.
